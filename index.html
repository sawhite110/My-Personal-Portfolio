            If you're looking to build dynamic, user friendly, and functional
            web applications, look no further. Throughout my coding journey, I have been working
            full time and continuously learning and building the necessary
            skills to obtain my certificate in the Full Stack Coding program
            from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Coding
            Bootcamp. During this process I gained skills in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, SQL, & MongoDB, while also using the
            command line and GitHub. Being organized, a great communicator, and
            calm under pressure, allow me to complete work and assignments in a
            timely manner. Iâ€™m also passionate about solving problems and
            creating innovative mobile and web applications to increase the user
            experience. I look forward to working in a fast-paced Agile team
            environment, where I can leverage my skills to build better
            applications and enhance the user experience on the web.
